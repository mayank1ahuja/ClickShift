<h2 align = "center"> ClickShift: Campaign Performance Analysis with A/B Testing </h2>

## `TL;DR`
This reproducible analytics project was developed to evaluate and optimize marketing campaign performance for a SaaS business through A/B testing. Deliverables include reproducible SQL scripts, Jupyter notebooks for statistical testing, and an interactive Tableau dashboard for comparative insights between campaign variants.

## `Project Overview`

Marketing teams often run multiple campaign variants — different creatives, messaging, or channels — but lack clear, data-backed methods to identify which performs best. ClickShift bridges that gap.  
It is a data analysis case study designed to measure and visualize the impact of A/B campaign experiments across key performance indicators like **conversion rate**, **click-through rate (CTR)**, and **ROI**.  
By combining SQL-based aggregation, Python statistical testing, and Tableau dashboards, the project transforms raw campaign data into decision-grade insights that marketing strategists can act upon.

## `Background and Motivation`
In digital marketing, campaign budgets are often allocated across multiple ad or email variants without a robust evidence base. Small design changes can significantly affect engagement and conversion outcomes, yet these differences are rarely quantified statistically.  
ClickShift addresses this by implementing a reproducible, data-driven A/B testing framework. The goal is to help SaaS teams **quantify campaign effectiveness**, **identify winning variants**, and **reallocate spend** toward the most efficient channels or creatives.
